        Like the comic, The Sandman tells the story of Dream / Morpheus, the
        titular Sandman. The series stars Tom Sturridge as the title character,
        with Boyd Holbrook, Vivienne Acheampong, and Patton Oswalt in supporting
        roles. Efforts to adapt The Sandman to film began in 1991, and
        floundered in development hell for many years. In 2013, Goyer pitched a
        film adaptation of the series to Warner Bros. Goyer and Gaiman were set
        to produce alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who was planned to star and
        possibly direct. However, Gordon-Levitt exited over creative differences
        in 2016. Due to the prolonged development of the film, Warner Bros.
        shifted its focus to television. Netflix signed a deal to produce the
        series in June 2019, and filming lasted from October 2020 to August
        2021. The Sandman premiered on August 5, 2022, with a further episode
        premiering on August 19. It received generally positive reviews from
        critics, with praise going towards the casting, production design,
        costumes, faithfulness to its source material, visual effects, and
        performances, particularly those of Sturridge and David Thewlis.

        years, Dream escapes and sets out to restore order to his realm, The
        Dreaming.[5]

      <h3>Co-starring</h3>

        <li>
          David Thewlis as John Dee, Cripps's and Burgess's son, whose endeavor
          to find "truth" jeopardizes the world. Gaiman described Dee as a
          character "who could break your heart and keep your sympathy while
          taking you into the darkest places"
        </li>
        <li>
          Jenna Coleman as Johanna Constantine, an occult detective. Coleman
          plays two versions of the character: the present day descendant based
          on John Constantine, and her identical eighteenth century ancestor
          Lady Johanna Constantine.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gwendoline Christie as Lucifer Morningstar, the ruler of Hell. This
          series' incarnation of Lucifer is much closer to the character's
          original depiction in the comics than his depiction in the 2016
          Lucifer television series. Neil Gaiman noted that it would be
          difficult to reconfigure the Lucifer version, portrayed by Tom Ellis,
          so he would fit back into The Sandman.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Death, the personification of death and
          Dream's kinder, wiser sister.

        <li>
          Ferdinand Kingsley as Hob Gadling, Dream’s friend who has lived for
          hundreds of years.

        <li>
          Sandra James-Young as Unity Kinkaid, Rose's benefactor and
          great-grandmother who has recently awakened from a century-long
          slumber.
        </li>
        <li>
          Kyo Ra as Rose Walker / The Vortex, a young woman searching for her
          lost brother who becomes a prey of the Corinthian.

        <li>
          Razane Jammal as Lyta Hall, Rose's friend and a widow mourning her
          husband.

        <li>
          Melissanthi Mahut as Calliope, Homer's muse, and ex-wife of Morpheus /
          Dream.

        While attempting to apprehend a nightmare known as the Corinthian,
        Morpheus, also known as Dream, is captured in an occult ritual by
        British aristocrat Roderick Burgess, who was attempting to capture
        Death. Roderick steals Morpheus's totems of power: his helm, a pouch of
        sand, and a ruby; all of which are eventually taken by Roderick's
        resentful lover Ethel Cripps, who is pregnant with Roderick's child.
        Morpheus's imprisonment causes an epidemic of "sleepy sickness" which
        lasts for 106 years. In 2021, Roderick's son, Alex, is an old man who
        continues to keep Morpheus imprisoned and is cared for by his partner,
        Paul. After Paul "accidentally" erases part of the runes keeping
        Morpheus bound, Morpheus reaches into the dream of one of his guards to
        destroy his cage, allowing him to escape, condemning Alex to an eternal
        sleep.

        Morpheus returns to the Dreaming, his kingdom and the source of dreams.
        There, he finds his palace in ruins due to his prolonged absence.
        Morpheus visits Cain and Abel, a pair of dysfunctional brothers, to
        retrieve their pet gargoyle Gregory, which will restore his power enough
        to summon the Fates. Morpheus successfully summons the Fates who inform
        him of the whereabouts of his equipment; the pouch of sand is in the
        possession of exorcist Johanna Constantine, his helm in the hands of a
        demon in Hell, and the ruby used by Ethel's son John Dee. Morpheus sets
        off on his quest to retrieve his items with assistance from his advisor
        Matthew the Raven. Back in the Dreaming, Morpheus sends a baby gargoyle
        to Cain and Abel to replace their previous companion.
